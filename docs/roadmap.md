Minimum guidelines:
- come back around
- prioritize leaks
- comment code
- take requests
- document development

Some developments that could be useful:
- Could made Layouts and UI look nice
- Expand the public node list


Dero-related technologies to be integrated into this program:
```txt
Native DERO tools
- ~~Explorer~~   // refinements are always welcome
- ~~Simulator~~  // would be nice if mining worked right under siulation
- Miner          // might be helpful to explore, probably better as another repo
- Daemon         // think this would be neat to do as another repo
  
Civilware Integrations:
- ~~ENCRYPTED_DEFAULT_PAYLOAD_CBOR_V2~~  // implemented
- ~~Epoch Management~~                   // implemented, opinionated - more toggles and switches could be nice
- ~~XSWD Websocket~~                     // implemented, expanding methods for gnomon integration
- ~~Gnomon integration~~                 // implemented, see: https://github.com/secretnamebasis/simple-gnomon
- Tela Installer & Server // see: https://github.com/secretnamebasis/simple-tela, https://github.com/secretnamebasis/simple-tela-viewer
