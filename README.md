# Installation

You will need Go, and a newer version is recommended. Fyne has its own set of dependencies: [https://docs.fyne.io/started/](https://docs.fyne.io/started/)

Be sure to check out the [releases](https://github.com/secretnamebasis/simple-wallet/releases) for linux and windows binaries; maybe one day I will be able to afford a mac...  

If you would like to build from source:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/secretnamebasis/simple-wallet
cd simple-wallet
go build .
./simple-wallet
```

Or you can simply run the program:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/secretnamebasis/simple-wallet
cd simple-wallet
go run .
```

Or, assuming you have a properly configured `go` environment:
```sh
go install github.com/secretnamebasis/simple-wallet@latest
simple-wallet
```

# Development

Most of the dev process has been to imbue a GUI with as much of the present wallet client tools as possible, while also introducing some components that make it easier to dev on the DERO blockchain.   

Some other developments that could be useful:
- Expand the public node list
- Multiple desktop environments, there have been zero tests in Microsoft or MacOS environments â€” strongly doubt iOS app would ever happen.

There are many additional Dero-related technologies that could be integrated into this program:

- Native DERO tools
  - ~~Explorer~~
  - ~~Simulator~~
  - Miner
  - Daemon
- Civilware Integrations:
  - ~~ENCRYPTED_DEFAULT_PAYLOAD_CBOR_V2~~
  - ~~Gnomon integration~~ 
  - ~~XSWD Websocket~~
  - Tela Installer & Server
  - Epoch Management
